## Implementation of a Basic Neural Network using CUDA

For this project, I am implementing a basic neural network using CUDA and testing and benchmarking using the MNIST dataset. The neural network will include input layers, hidden layers, reLu activation with forward and backward propagation.
I will then do benchmark testing of my NN on the MNIST dataset (https://git-disl.github.io/GTDLBench/datasets/mnist_datasets/).


## So Far
So far i have the bench worklflow with a single hidden layer work on small arrays. I need to clean it up, increase the number of hidden layers, and then benchmark. This is a solo project.
