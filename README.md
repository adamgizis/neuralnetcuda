## Implementation of a Basic Neural Network using CUDA

Implementation of a single hidden layer MLP for MNIST dataset with reLu and softmax using CUDA. Attempted matrix multiplication. Comparable python scripts in kera_benchmark.py.

## To run

Must have Nvidia GPU to run. 
To get MNIST dataset from kaggle, start virtual enviroment (requirements.txt )
```python download_mnist.py```
To run CUDA training 
``` make

./app

```
